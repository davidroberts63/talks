# Intro to making Chrome extensions
Ever want to add some feature or change the way a website works? Add sort capability or a search box for something you use daily? You can do that with Chrome extensions. With your existing Javascript skills you can learn to create a Chrome extension. Keep it to yourself or publish it on the Chrome Web Store. Join me to learn the basics of Chrom extensions from creating your first simple extension to publishing it into the Chrome Web Store.

#### General note for organizers
All of the experience for this talk comes from writing a single Chrome extension: [Bluefin](https://github.com/davidroberts63/octopygmy). I won't mention the Bluefin extension except briefly so as to show a before and after example in the session of what can be done. I will have a sample to work through (likely messing with google.com or some other common website) that I will have copied locally to avoid internet connectivity issues.

#### Points to cover
