# Intro to making Chrome extensions

## General note for organizers
All of the experience for this talk comes from writing a single Chrome extension: [Bluefin][https://github.com/davidroberts63/octopygmy]. For a product called Octopus Deploy. I won't mention the Octopus product nor the Bluefin extension except briefly so as to show a before and after example in the session of what can be done. I will have a sample to work through (likely messing with google.com or some other common website) that I will have copied locally to avoid internet connectivity issues.

## Points to cover
- The manifest
- Permissions
- Content scripts
- Browser/page actions
- Background/Event scritps
- Options pages (and storage)
- Common chrome.* APIs
- Publishing in the developer dashboard
