# Potential titles for Kids, programming and building

### General idea of talk
My son loves playing with Legos. We combined them with littlebits and had wonderful fun. Thinking there might be a way (as I've been wanting) to combine the building with programming. We have Mindstorms but haven't dug into it as much.

O.O what if my son was there doing the talk with me? He's 5 so maybe just to show some stuff. _pondering_
