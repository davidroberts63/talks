### Continuously deploy with nearly any static site tool.

You may have used the Jekyll integration in Github Pages for your site; but moved onto some other static tool or web host. At the same time you may have lost that ease of deployment. No longer able to 'git push' and walk away knowing the site will get updated. There is a way to get that back.

In this talk you will see how to regain a continuous deployment process for virtually any static site generator or web host; with the added benefit of site previews of changes as 'tests'. Join us as we use PhantomJS and Express.js to discover how you can keep delivering and have your static site too.
