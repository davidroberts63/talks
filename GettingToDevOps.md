# How we are getting to DevOps

You've heard "Do DevOps! Now!". You've seen some tools, maybe you've heard about what to do and what not to do. But...what about actually doing it?

Well I'm going to tell you how we are getting there, in a regulated enterprise company with over 200 IT employees. I'll describe the pain we experience and the successes that push adoption. You will hear about the subtle and not so subtle push-back. The ways that we have engaged team members across security, network, servers and change control will give you insight into how you may be able to do the same in your organization.

This is not a product demo but you will see the tools and practices that we use today. You can take our experiences of going from quarterly/monthly deployments to weekly/daily deployments. There is still room to grow and you'll find out what's coming next for us and points you can take away to consider how they apply in your workflow.

Join me to see how one organization is traversing the journey to a DevOps culture, to take away ideas to use for yourself.
