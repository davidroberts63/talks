# How we are getting to DevOps

You've heard "Do DevOps! Now!". You've seen some tools, maybe you've heard about what to do and what not to do. But...what about actually doing it?

Well I'm going to tell you how we are getting there, in a regulated enterprise company with over 200 IT employees. I'll describe the pain we experienced and the successes that pushed adoption. You will hear about the subtle and not so subtle push-back. Ways that we have engaged team members across security, network, servers and change control will give you insight into how you may be able to do the same in your organization.

This is not a product demo but you will see the tools and practices that we use today. We have gone from monthly deployments to weekly and daily deployments so we still have room to grow; and we will tell you what's coming next for us and points to consider.

Join me to see how one organization is traversing the journey to a DevOps culture, improving our productivity and business value to our customers.
