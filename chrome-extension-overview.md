# A trip through a worldwide Chrome extension

You've likely used Chrome extensions but what goes into one? What can you do with them and how do you continuously deliver functionality? I won't give you a detailed tutorial on building Chrome extensions. But I will show you what it took to make one that is used in a dozen countries. Publishing it in the Chrome Webstore. Responding to user issues/questions and accepting contributions. Tracking usage via analytics, browser testing and deployment in a continuous delivery flow. All of this to give you a headstart to your own success.
