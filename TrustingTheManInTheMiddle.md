# Trusting the man in the middle

Do you experience 'SSL connection refused, untrusted self signed certificate' type errors in your development environment?

We can fix this in our browsers without to much trouble, but it's a bit more difficult with development tools.

Come find out how you can get your node, git, r, go, rust, ruby, .net, and python development environments, in Linux and Windows, to trust these man in the middle certificates and let you get on with your work.
