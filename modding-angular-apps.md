# Modding Angular Apps

It's becoming more likely you may use a product that is an Angular app. And you may wish it had some extra features. To do so, you will need to become familiar with somewhat lesser known areas of Angular to add those features seamlessly. You can do this via Chrome Extensions or server side depending on the product. In this session you will see how to add your modules, inject your views and use your directives in an existing Angular app. Join me and discover the realm of modding Angular 1.5 apps.



## Everything below are my own notes for the talk. Will not be mentioned in abstract but may be divulged if conference organizers want more information.

### General notes (not for abstract)
The audience would be people that know at least a little bit of Angular, such as understanding what directives are. I had only a little bit of knowledge with it and used this as a great way to learn more about Angular.

#### Points to cover (not for abstract)
- Why do this at all? Because it's not your app. Show case Octopus Deploy **very briefly** since that's what I'm working with.
- Injecting your modules into the overall Angular app.
- Modifying existing templates.
- Adding directives to existing elements.
- The truth about Chrome Extensions and how to use it to your advantage.
- Probably NOT go into detail of Chrome Extensions but will consider it. Focus is on the Angular modding side of things.
