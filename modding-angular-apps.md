# Modding Angular Apps

It's becoming more likely you may use a product that is an Angular app. And you may wish it had some extra features. I've run across this very situation and dug into somewhat lesser known areas of Angular to add features seamlessly. Some was done via Chrome Extensions, some was done server side. You will learn about injecting your mod, changing the existing app and more. Join me and discover the realm of modding Angular apps.

### General notes (not for abstract)
The audience would be people that know at least a little bit of Angular, such as understanding what directives are. I had only a little bit of knowledge with it and used this as a great way to learn more about Angular.

#### Points to cover
- Why do this at all? Because it's not your app. Show case Octopus Deploy very briefly since that's what I'm working with.
- Injecting your modules into the overall Angular app.
- Modifying existing templates.
- Adding directives to existing elements.
- The truth about Chrome Extensions and how to use it to your advantage.
- Probably NOT go into detail of Chrome Extensions but will consider it. Focus is on the Angular modding side of things.
