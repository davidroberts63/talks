# Talk Abstracts
Abstracts for various talks (user groups, conferences, etc)

### Be sure to check the [pull requests](https://github.com/davidroberts63/talks/pulls) for new talk ideas I'm having.

### [Issues](https://github.com/davidroberts63/talks/issues) are (currently) where I'm taking feedback on changes to existing talk abstracts.
